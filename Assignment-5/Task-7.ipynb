    "1. Bagging vs Boosting:\n",
    "Bagging: Builds models independently in parallel (e.g., Random Forest).\n",
    "Boosting: Builds models sequentially, correcting previous errors (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest Reduces Variance:\n",
    "By averaging predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets, it reduces overfitting and hence lowers variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weakness of Boosting:\n",
    "Boosting can overfit noisy data and is more sensitive to outliers due to its focus on hard examples."
